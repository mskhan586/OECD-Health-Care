# OECD Health Care Status

The purpose of this Power BI project is to get insights related to the status of the health care system in OECD and some non-OECD countries. The users of the reports can also compare the progress of health care systems across countries over the years by using dynamic and animated bubble chart visualization. The data for this project has been gathered from https://stats.oecd.org/. The project will be further extended to include insights related to mortality rate, life expectancy, and COVID-19 statistics.
